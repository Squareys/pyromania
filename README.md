Pyromania
=========

*Archived code of my attempt to make a POCO and Irrlicht based Bomberman clone, 2011-2013*

Read more about it on my [blog](http://blog.squareys.de/tag/pyromania/).

This code currently only contains the 3D version of the client, which I only posted
[on facebook](https://www.facebook.com/Squareys/photos/a.194342153966540.47777.177219555678800/570479649686120/)
about (once).
The 2D and 3D client both share game and net code. Should I find the 2D client code, I will of course add it
to this repository.

**Note:** I created this in my early days of programming and I didn't touch a line of code since, do not infer
any qualities about my current code from it.

# Building

*It may not compile.*

I honestly don't know. Back then I was using [MinGW](http://mingw.org/), judging from some exectuables
the standard 32 bit version (I later switched to MinGW64).

You will notice the folders contain a set of Eclipse CDT ".project" files. You can hopefully just import
them into an Eclipse CDT and go with it.

As far as I can tell, you'll need to build "Pyromania Gamelogic" first, which builds a static library used
by both the client and server.

## Dependencies

Some old version from 2011/2012 (;P) of the following libraries:

 - Irrlicht
 - POCO
 - Maybe SDL2 (I am unsure why I had that "SDL Test" project there)

# Maps

I created the maps using [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/). To convert the resulting ".dat" file to
a set of .map files, you will need to compile and use "PyromaniaMapConverter".


# Running

You will need to start the server first, then the client, obviously ;)
